# Some of my projects

- [WaybackUrls.pl](https://github.com/LvMalware/waybackurls.pl)
    
    -- A Perl version of [waybackurls](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls) with the added feature of filtering the results based on MIME-Type, status code and file extension.

- [IPerl](https://github.com/LvMalware/iperl)

    -- A small REPL script to run an interactive Perl interpreter.

- [WebFuzzer](https://github.com/LvMalware/webfuzzer)

    -- A simple and fast web fuzzer with support for multiple threads and the use of filters.

- [CTFTools](https://github.com/LvMalware/CTFTools)

    -- Some tools I write for CTF competitions

- [LVHA256](https://github.com/LvMalware/lvha256)

    -- My own cryptographic hashing algorithm (don't use it for real, I can't guarantee its security)

- [LvCipher](https://github.com/LvMalware/LvCipher)

    -- Another of my adventures on Crypto. This is an EXPERIMENTAL block cipher algorithm that I created using the symmetric structure known as [Feistel network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feistel_cipher).
